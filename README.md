## Description
A responsive, single-page portfolio that includes an About Me section, a Projects section, and a Contacts section. This portfolio was built using the Materilize CSS framework and includes some parallax images. I utilized an object with all information for each project to populate the project cards dynamically.

## Built With

### CSS Framework
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)

### Third Party APIs
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Future Development
There are a number of features I would like to implement in the future to improve this portfolio:
1. Improve the styling of the project elements - do something without using the cards; maybe add a carousel.
2. Make the title page (with the lightening in the background) take up the whole page and move away off to the left to reveal the rest of the page.

## Credits
* Thanks to the UNH Bootcamp instructor, TAs, and tutors for giving us great instruction, resources, and support.
